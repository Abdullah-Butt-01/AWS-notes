* sudo systemctl enable ssh

## what I did

* Make it active using "sudo systemctl start ssh"
* Copied VM IP address
* "ssh username@IP" to c

## Problems Faced

## How I fixed

* Restarted networking services "sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager", and cleaned "sudo apt clean"

## Key Learnings
* SSH: Secure remote terminal access
	- Here; AWS EC2 = VM
